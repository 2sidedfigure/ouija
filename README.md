# Ouija

Server software for proxying HTTP requests through 
[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org). It'll make your automated requests look 
*more* human!

## Requirements

[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) must be 
[installed](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) and available in the `PATH`.

## Usage

Once the server is up and running, simply issue requests to it like you would 
to any other proxy server. This means providing the host when requesting the 
resource, e.g.:

 > GET http://example.com/foo/bar.html

...instead of:

 > GET /foo/bar.html

### Special HTTP Headers

Ouija accepts some special HTTP headers for manipulating the response or 
configuring the resulting request. As usual, the header names are 
case-insensitive.

 - **Ouija-Get-Unmodified-Content**: Normally, if scripts on the page modify 
   the DOM of the requested page, Ouija will return the modified source. 
   Passing this header will ensure you recieve the unmodified source. The value 
   of the header is inconsequential; Ouija only checks for its presence.

 - **Ouija-Pass-***: Any headers prefixed with *Ouija-Pass-* will be used in 
   the resulting request (with *Ouija-Pass-* stripped from the name). E.g., 
   passing:

    > Ouija-Pass-User-Agent: Ouijabot

   ...will result in the following header in the resulting request:

    > User-Agent: Ouijabot
